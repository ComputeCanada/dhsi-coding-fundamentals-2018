<a name="mt1-55"></a>Owing to the death of William Percy of Castlelevington and the minority of his son William the manor of Castlelevington was taken into the hands of Richard II. Christina, the widow of the elder William, holds a third part in dower and she still lives. The other two parts remain in the king’s hands. William held it in his demesne in fee tail by the grant years ago of Robert Conyers, knight, Thomas de Boynton, knight, and John Conyers, brother of Robert, with remainder if he had no heirs to Margaret his sister and the heirs of her body, and failing them to the said Robert, Thomas and John. It is held of the king in chief by fealty and the service of finding a man with an unbarded horse, armed with acton, pallet, lance and gauntlets of plate, for forty days when there is a war in Scotland. The two parts in the king’s hands are worth 10 marks annually.
<br>Also after the death of the elder William the manor of Tanton with its appurtenances, and 8 messuages, 5 tofts, 7 bovates and 7 a. of land in Kildale, and 1 messuage and 5 bovates in Newby were taken into the king’s hands. They are held of various lords, Thomas earl of Kent, John Lord Darcy, John Percy of Kildale, and William Mowbray of Newby, as appears by an inquisition taken after his death [<em>CIPM</em> XVII, no. 1079]. The annual values are, Tanton 10 marks, Kildale 20s., and Newby 5 marks.
<br>Afterwards because it was found in the inquisition that his manor and the other premises were held jointly by William and Christina his wife, to them and their heirs, they were released from the king’s hands. The two parts of Castlelevington manor should descend to Margaret wife of Thomas Blanfront and her heirs. She is the next heir as sister of William the father and she is aged 30 years and more. William the son died on 8 Oct. last.
