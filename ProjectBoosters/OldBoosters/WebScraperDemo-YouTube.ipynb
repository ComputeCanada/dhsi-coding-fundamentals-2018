Here he is, a crime lord, surrounded by other scumbags, and yet he manages to make it sound like he and his fellows support society and keep it from crashing down in their own, twisted way. Like they're a pillar of good society. If anything, at least the man was charismatic. Almost makes me regret blowing up his gunship.........\n",

      "definitely South African!! i can guarantee it. Although you can hear that is someone who is a voice actor. South african \"black\" people have a diff accent to the \"white\" people. There there are Eng speaking \"white\" people and Afrikaans speaking \"white\" people. Im a Afrikaans Speaking White person. i do not have a strong accent like this.i immigrated to australia when i was 13 an am 22 now.Most afrikaans speaking whites have a accent sort of like this some accents are more noticeable then others \n",

The voice actor is SA, an English speaking SA(who is fluent in Afrikaans)...perhaps other SA's have experienced differently, but Afrikaans speakers are far more fluid in their spoken word, even when speaking English (and with all the errors due to grammar differences)....it sounds more like someone gave him cues on how they thought he should sound...\n",
